# Spotify Data Visualization Project

This GitHub repository contains a data visualization project that utilizes the Spotipy API to collect data from a single Spotify playlist from your account. The project then conducts an analysis and creates histograms based on various audio features, including 'Danceability', 'Energy', 'Loudness', 'Speechiness', 'Acousticness', 'Instrumentalness', 'Liveness', 'Tempo', and 'Valence'.

## Introduction

This project aims to explore and visualize the audio characteristics of the tracks in a Spotify playlist. The Spotipy API is used to collect data on the specified audio features for each track in the playlist. The collected data is then analyzed and visualized through histograms to gain insights into the musical preferences within the playlist.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

1. Python 3.x installed
2. Spotipy library installed (for interacting with the Spotify API)
3. Spotify Developer Account and API credentials
4. A Spotify playlist ID from your account

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip.
3. Create a Spotify Developer Account and obtain your API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret). You can create a Spotify Developer Account and obtain these credentials here.
4. Set your Spotify API credentials as environment variables.


## Process for Using the Spotify Data Visualization Project
1. Clone the Repository: Start by cloning the GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Install Required Dependencies: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
3. Spotify Developer Account: To access the Spotify API, you need to have a Spotify Developer Account.
4. API Credentials: Once you have a Spotify Developer Account, obtain your API credentials:
5. Client ID: This is a unique identifier for your application.
6. Client Secret: A secret key for authorizing your application.
7. Set Environment Variables: To keep your API credentials secure, set them as environment variables on your local machine.
8. Collect Your Playlist ID: You'll need the Spotify playlist ID from your account that you want to analyze. Make sure you have the correct playlist ID ready for use.
9. Run the Project: Execute the project according to the provided instructions in the README. This might involve running Python scripts or commands in your terminal.
10. View Visualizations: Once the project has executed, it will generate visualizations, typically histograms, based on audio features such as 'Danceability', 'Energy', 'Loudness', etc. You can view and interpret these visualizations to gain insights into the music in your playlist
